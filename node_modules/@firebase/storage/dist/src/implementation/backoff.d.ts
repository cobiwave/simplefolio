 * Accepts a callback for an action to perform (`doRequest`),

 * When `start` calls `doRequest`, it passes a callback for when the request has
 * completed, `onRequestComplete`. Based on this, the backoff continues, with
 * another call to `doRequest` and the above loop continues until the timeout
 * is hit, or a successful response occurs.
