/**
 * Changes the {@link Auth} instance to communicate with the Firebase Auth Emulator, instead of production
 * Firebase Auth services.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This must be called synchronously immediately following the first call to
 * {@link initializeAuth}.  Do not use with production credentials as emulator
 * traffic is not encrypted.
 *
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * connectAuthEmulator(auth, 'http://127.0.0.1:9099', { disableWarnings: true });
 * ```
 *
 * @param auth - The {@link Auth} instance.
 * @param url - The URL at which the emulator is running (eg, 'http://localhost:9099').
 * @param options - Optional. `options.disableWarnings` defaults to `false`. Set it to
 * `true` to disable the warning banner attached to the DOM.
 *
 * @public
