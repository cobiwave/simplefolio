 * This function allows more control over the {@link Auth} instance than
 * {@link getAuth}. `getAuth` uses platform-specific defaults to supply

 * need control over which persistence layer is used, or to minimize bundle
 * size if you're not using either `signInWithPopup` or `signInWithRedirect`.
 *
 * For example, if your app only uses anonymous accounts and you only want
 * accounts saved for the current session, initialize `Auth` with:
 *
 * ```js
 * const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
 *   persistence: browserSessionPersistence,
 *   popupRedirectResolver: undefined,

 * Sends a sign-in email link to the user with the specified email.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The sign-in operation has to always be completed in the app unlike other out of band email
 * actions (password reset and email verifications). This is because, at the end of the flow,
 * the user is expected to be signed in and their Auth state persisted within the app.
 *
 * To complete sign in with the email link, call {@link signInWithEmailLink} with the email
 * address and the email link supplied in the email sent to the user.
 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript
 * const actionCodeSettings = {
 *   url: 'https://www.example.com/?email=user@example.com',
 *   iOS: {
 *      bundleId: 'com.example.ios'
 *   },

 * };
 * await sendSignInLinkToEmail(auth, 'user@example.com', actionCodeSettings);
 * // Obtain emailLink from the user.
 * if(isSignInWithEmailLink(auth, emailLink)) {
 *   await signInWithEmailLink(auth, 'user@example.com', emailLink);

 * Loading the reCAPTCHA config early will also enhance the signal collected by reCAPTCHA.
