 * The `in` filter is only a syntactic sugar over a disjunction of equalities. For instance: `a in
 * [1,2,3]` is in fact `a==1 || a==2 || a==3`. This method expands any `in` filter in the given
 * input into a disjunction of equality filters and returns the expanded filter.

 * input: (A || B) && C, the DNF form is: (A && C) || (B && C), and the return value is a list
 * with two elements: a composite filter that performs (A && C), and a composite filter that
