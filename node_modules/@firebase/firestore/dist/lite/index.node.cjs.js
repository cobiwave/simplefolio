 * A mutation describes a self-contained change to a document. Mutations can

 * the existing version for Set and Patch mutations. For Delete mutations, we
 * reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.

 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as

 * explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we transition to an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us
